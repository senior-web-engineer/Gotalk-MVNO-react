    summary: 'How does eSIM work?',
    details: `An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM that allows you to activate service without a physical SIM– it’s a fast way to connect. With eSIM, you can quickly switch providers (takes 10 minutes or less to switch)! It’s great for businesses, because you can store multiple operator profiles on a device simultaneously, and you can switch between them rapidly as you’re not limited to just one plan, like with a physical SIM. eSIM is especially great for digital nomads, travel enthusiasts, business owners, or people who just want to have a lot of
    flexibility in their telecom network. iPhone XS and above includes e-sim support.
